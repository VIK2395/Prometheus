# Ways to deploy prometheus monitoring stack in k8s

- Create all k8s resources/components via deployments yaml files yourself (NOT EFFICIENT). [Manage everything manually]
- Using **Prometheus operator** (MORE EFFICIENT). [Deploy only Prometheus operator, and it will automatically manage PMS components]
  - https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator
  - Manages all PMS components
  - But still requires manual initial setup
- Using helm chart to deploy (MOST EFFICIENT)
  - https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack
  - Includes/uses **Prometheus operator**
  - Helm: initial setup
  - Prometheus operator: manage prometheus PMS components

# `prometheus-operator` vs `kube-prometheus-stack`

The **`prometheus-operator`** repository and the **`kube-prometheus-stack` Helm chart** serve different but related purposes in the Prometheus monitoring ecosystem. Here's a breakdown of the differences:

---

### 1. **Prometheus Operator Repository**
**URL**: [https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator)

#### Purpose:
- **Core tool** for managing Prometheus instances and related resources (e.g., Alertmanager, PrometheusRules) in Kubernetes clusters.
- Provides a Kubernetes-native way of deploying and managing Prometheus components using custom resources.

#### Key Features:
- Implements Kubernetes **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)** for Prometheus, Alertmanager, ServiceMonitor, and PodMonitor.
- Automates deployment, configuration, and management of Prometheus and Alertmanager instances.
- Simplifies managing Prometheus configurations (e.g., scrape configs, alerts) using Kubernetes-native YAML.

#### Primary Components:
1. **Custom Resources**:
   - `Prometheus`: Defines a Prometheus instance.
   - `Alertmanager`: Defines an Alertmanager instance.
   - `ServiceMonitor` and `PodMonitor`: Specify what services or pods Prometheus should scrape.
   - `PrometheusRule`: Defines alerting and recording rules.
2. **Operator Controller**:
   - Manages the lifecycle of Prometheus and Alertmanager instances, ensuring their desired state.

#### Use Cases:
- For those who want full control over Prometheus setup in Kubernetes using Kubernetes-native APIs.
- Ideal for developers/teams who prefer building their own monitoring stack manually or require fine-grained control over configuration.

### 2. **Kube-Prometheus-Stack Helm Chart**
**URL**: [https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack)

#### Purpose:
- **Prepackaged monitoring stack** for Kubernetes, which includes Prometheus, Alertmanager, Grafana, and more.
- Provides a turn-key solution for deploying a complete Prometheus-based monitoring stack via Helm.

#### Key Features:
- Bundles the Prometheus Operator for managing Prometheus and Alertmanager instances.
- Includes pre-configured dashboards, alerting rules, and scrape configurations for Kubernetes monitoring.
- Deploys the following components:
  - Prometheus
  - Alertmanager
  - Grafana (with Kubernetes dashboards)
  - Node Exporter
  - Kube-State-Metrics
  - ServiceMonitors and PodMonitors for Kubernetes objects
  - Predefined alerting rules (via `PrometheusRule` resources)
- Highly customizable via Helm values for adapting to specific needs.

#### Use Cases:
- For teams looking for a **ready-to-use monitoring stack** with minimal configuration.
- Suitable for beginners or those who want to quickly deploy monitoring without worrying about setting up individual components.
- Ideal for Kubernetes environments where observability is required out-of-the-box.

### Comparison Table

| **Aspect**                     | **Prometheus Operator**                                    | **Kube-Prometheus-Stack**                             |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                     | Manage Prometheus components using CRDs.                  | Deploy a complete monitoring stack via Helm.         |
| **Ease of Use**                 | Requires manual setup of Prometheus and related CRDs.     | Simplified deployment with pre-configured settings.  |
| **Components Included**         | Only the Prometheus Operator (core controller).           | Prometheus, Alertmanager, Grafana, Node Exporter, etc. |
| **Configuration**               | Full control over CRDs and YAML configurations.           | Configurable via Helm values.                        |
| **Best For**                    | Advanced users needing custom setups or tighter control.  | Teams wanting a quick, preconfigured stack.          |
| **Deployment Method**           | Kubernetes manifests with CRDs.                          | Helm chart.                                          |
| **Out-of-the-Box Dashboards**   | No dashboards included.                                   | Includes prebuilt dashboards (e.g., Kubernetes metrics). |
| **Alerting Rules**              | Must be defined manually via `PrometheusRule` CRDs.       | Includes default alerting rules.                     |

### When to Use Each:

#### **Prometheus Operator**
- Use when:
  - You want to customize every aspect of the Prometheus setup.
  - You have existing CRDs or YAML-based pipelines for managing Kubernetes resources.
  - Your environment demands flexibility and fine-grained control.

#### **Kube-Prometheus-Stack**
- Use when:
  - You want a **quick start** for Kubernetes monitoring.
  - You prefer a prepackaged stack that includes dashboards and exporters.
  - You want an easy way to manage the stack via Helm.

---

### Key Notes:
1. **The Kube-Prometheus-Stack Helm Chart Uses the Prometheus Operator**:
   - The Prometheus Operator is a core part of the kube-prometheus-stack Helm chart. It manages Prometheus and Alertmanager instances within the stack.
   - If you deploy kube-prometheus-stack, you are indirectly using the Prometheus Operator.

2. **Customizations**:
   - With kube-prometheus-stack, you can customize Prometheus Operator settings (e.g., scrape intervals, alert rules) via Helm values.
   - Directly using the Prometheus Operator gives you finer control but requires more effort.

In summary, if youâ€™re building a custom solution or need full control, use the **Prometheus Operator** directly. If you want an out-of-the-box monitoring solution for Kubernetes, go with the **Kube-Prometheus-Stack Helm chart**.
